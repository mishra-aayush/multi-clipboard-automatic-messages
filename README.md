# Multi-Clipboard Automatic Messages

To respond to a large number of emails with similar phrasing, we have to do a lot of repetitive typing.  
We can solve this by keeping a text document with these phrases so we can easily copy and paste them using the clipboard.  
But our clipboard can only store one message at a time, which isn’t very convenient.  
Therefore, this program helps you automate these messages and helps store multiple phrases. 

#### Usage

* Use the following command to run the program on your terminal `python mclip.py [keyphrase]`
* If the keyphrase exists in the dictionary, the message would be copied.
* Else an error or warning would be thrown.
